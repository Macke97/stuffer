# Extensions

Stuffer is a framework that handles uploads and downloads,
the point is that you can, and should, extend it to suit your needs.

## Core Extensions

Stuffer comes with some extensions already. They are basically features that you can
opt-in with an enviroment variable:

    STUFFER_CORE_EXTENSIONS=ext1|ext2|...

Then you need to refer to each extension's documentation page to learn how to use it
and how to configure it.
